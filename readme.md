To give shoppers a better shopping experience.  Utilizing a MySQL database, we will track where specific items are located in grocery stores.
Allowing the shopper to focus on better things.  Like your spotify playlist.

<H3>Description:</H3>
Grabbing groceries has never been so easy.  When you use our app, you will be able to track down your easy mac like an NSA agent.

<H3>Motivation:</H3>
We recently realized exactly how much time is wasted tracking down our favorite foods every week.  We decided it was time to change this.
